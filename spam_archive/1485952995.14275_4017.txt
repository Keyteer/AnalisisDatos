<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Top Benefits to Wearing Hearing Aids </p>

<!-- Paragraph 1 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Did you know that wearing hearing aids can actually increase your earning power? Research by the Better Hearing Institute found that untreated hearing loss can reduce annual earnings by as much as $30,000. The study also found that correcting hearing loss with hearing aids was found to reduce the risk of decreased earnings by over 90 percent for people with mild hearing loss, and nearly 77 percent for those with moderate-to-severe hearing loss.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 2 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Several studies have linked untreated hearing loss to an increased risk of developing dementia and reduced cognitive functioning. The decline appears greatest for those who do not wear hearing aids to correct hearing loss. A study from the University of Pennsylvania found that reduced hearing loss can actually accelerate atrophy in the auditory areas of the brain making speech understanding more difficult. The good news is that researchers have found that hearing aids help decrease atrophy while increasing hearing ability. The exciting new research further supports that treating hearing loss with hearing aids may slow the cognitive decline associated with hearing loss.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 3 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">More than 50 million Americans experience tinnitus, a high pitched ringing or clicking noise in the ears. With rare exception, tinnitus is usually accompanied by hearing loss. Wearing professionally-fit hearing aids to correct hearing loss can reduce the annoyance of tinnitus for many with hearing loss. Some products such as the Z Series product include technology specifically designed to alleviate tinnitus. Wearing hearing aids to correct hearing loss has also been shown to reduce the stress and annoyance associated with tinnitus.</p>

<!-- Paragraph 4 of text -->
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Finally, the Better Hearing Institute has found that people who wear hearing aids to correct their hearing loss enjoy a better quality of life than those who let hearing loss go untreated. They compiled a list to help show just how powerful better hearing can be.</p>
